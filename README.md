# CS51: Factors Affecting Student Success

## Final Submission Information

### URL
The website for my project can be found [here](http://benshry.github.io/cs171-pr-cs51).
This page contains links to my screen-cast, interactive visualization, and process book.

### My Code
There are two main sets of code that I wrote for this project. As discussed in my process book,
the first was a functional/exploratory set of visualization. This is the file index.html, which
relies on the files scripts.js and styles.css. _Note: index.html is not my final visualization._
The second set of code is my final visualization, and begins with the file named main.html. It
relies on the javascript in the js directory and the styles in the css directory.

### Data
The raw data for my project is not in the Github repository as some of it is sensitive. The
scripts directory contains the python scripts I wrote to handle the raw data (all CSVs). The
output of these scripts is in the output directory. Confusingly, the json files in the output
directory are what the visualization uses as input. These json files show the data used by the
application, and between them and the python scripts, the format of the initial data should be
clear.

### Libraries
Any code I did not write (*i.e.*, d3, jquery, and bootstrap-tour) is included in the libs directory.
