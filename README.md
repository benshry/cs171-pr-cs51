# Visualization of data from CS51

## Milestone 1 Info

The current visualizations can be viewed through index.html. All associated documents
(Process Book, design studio feedback, initial proposal) can be found in the
"documents" directory.

Note to grader: Some of the commit times are incorrect due to my development
environment's system clock being incorrect. Looking at the commit times,
it would seem I had an impossibly productive March 14. Alas, those commits
occurred over the following few weeks, and it was only a few days ago that
I noticed and fixed the issue.
