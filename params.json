{"name":"CS51","tagline":"Factors Affecting Student Success","body":"### Introduction\r\n\"CS51: Factors Affecting Student Success\" is a project investigating the performance of students in Computer Science 51, an introductory CS course at Harvard. It examines the relationship between a student's grade on assignments and their year, initial level of programming comfort, and interaction with the course's online discussion forum. \r\n\r\n### Visualization\r\nThe interactive visualization can be found [here] (http://benshry.github.io/cs171-pr-cs51/visualization.html).\r\n\r\n### Results\r\n\r\n####Basic Data\r\n\r\n#####Grades\r\nIn 2015, all problem sets were out of 75 points. Most students scored over 60. In 2014, each problem set had a different number of possible points, but a similar effect was observed.\r\n\r\n#####Comfort\r\nIn both years, students reported similar comfort levels. The distribution of comfort levels was approximately bell-shaped, with the most frequent scores being between 3 and 8 (on a 1-10 scale).\r\n\r\n#####Year\r\nBoth years, the number of freshman exceeds the number of sophomores, which exceeds the number of juniors, which exceeds the number of seniors.\r\n\r\n#####Online Forum\r\nIn both years, students viewed between 0 and approximately 1500 posts on Piazza. The max number of contributions was about 200. There is slightly more data from the year of 2014 because the 2015 offering of the course has not yet finished.\r\n\r\n####Trends and Relationships\r\n\r\nUpon initial inspection, there were fewer clear trends in the data than I was hoping. However, I was able to uncover some interesting relationships using my visualization.\r\n\r\n#####Comfort Level\r\nThe self-reported comfort level of the students at the beginning of the semester had little impact on their success on the problem sets. The top performers on each problem set were evenly distributed amongst the comfort levels. There are a variety of potential explanations for this observation. One I would like to mention is that the course is taught in Ocaml, a language that almost no students have previously encountered. This is explicitly done to provide students with an even playing field to learn about abstraction and design, and the observed results could indicate that this goal is accomplished.\r\n\r\n#####Discussion Forum\r\nIn 2015, none of the students that viewed more than 450 Piazza posts scored more than 1 standard deviation below the mean on the midterm. This effect persisted for almost every problem set. These students were evenly distributed amongst comfort levels and class years.\r\nThe students that make the most contributions on Piazza are evenly distributed across comfort levels.\r\n### Process Book\r\nThe process book details the steps I took while developing my solution, including how I collected the data, alternative designs I tried, and the insights I received.
