##Design Studio Feedback
###Ben Shryock

**Feedback By:** Alina Ranjbaran, Sam Udolf, and Michelle Choi

**Write a short document discussing the issues raised by your peers and add a sentence that details how you will address the feedback in future revisions.**

The group that reviewed my project had a variety of suggestions, most related to potential feature or data extensions. They thought both the audience and visualizations I suggested were appropriate. For the visualization sketch I presented (the set of four related bar charts from my proposal), they recommended adding the ability to click on multiple bars of a specific graph, causing the other graphs to update with the information contained in each of those bars.

After discussing the data I had access to, my peers suggested that incorporating data of student gender or Q-scores could be useful.

We also discussed ways of making the main visualization more visually appealing than a set of bar charts. My peers suggested the possibility of a sunburst visualization, or something akin to the Titanic multi-correlation data visualization we saw in class.

I plan to do the following things in response to this feedback. I'll likely incorporate their recommendations into my planned visualization. Adding gender data may not be possible (as that data currently doesn't exist), but I will investigate the possibility of working Q-score data into my plan. After implementing the initially planned visualizations, I will work on some of the formats that they suggested as well.

**Briefly comment on the quality of the feedback you received. Was it fair? Was it helpful?**

The feedback was quite useful. The feedback was fair, with a nice mix of supportive commentary and constructive suggestions. The feedback was helpful, and I left the design studion feeling like I had a variety of new ideas to pursue.
